Hi There! I am Ankit Basak.  
Final year Computer Science and Engineering student in KIIT, Bhubaneshwar. Currently a linux foundation mentee in the [Magma Core][magma-link] project, an open-source software platform that gives network operators an open, flexible and extendable mobile core network solution.  
I have interests in software development, networks, cloud and data analysis.

Beyond tech, I enjoy photography, capturing stories stories hidden in everyday life.  
You can expore my photography portfolio on [flickr][flickr-link], my technical work in [Github][github-link] and connect with me on [linkedin][linkedin-link].
